# Example apps are explicitly included via exceptions below.

# Ignore all app directories by default

# But keep these files
!.gitignore
!README.md

# Keep example apps
!example-task-manager/
!example-task-manager/**

!example-analytics-dashboard/
!example-analytics-dashboard/**

# Add your custom apps here by uncommenting and modifying:
